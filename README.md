**MEDSHAPENET FEEDBACK** is a platform for researchers to contribute shapes, provide feedbacks (e.g., report corrupted shapes for removal, suggest improvements) and showcase their own research/applications utilizing MedShapeNet. It is an important mean of communication for MedShapeNet developers, users and contributors for continuously refining the database and promoting the translation of shape-realted methods from computer vision to medical applications. Shape contributors have the chance of being listed as collaborators of the MedShapeNet project upon request.
