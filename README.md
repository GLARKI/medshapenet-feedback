&emsp;  &emsp; &emsp;   **[MedShapeNet](https://medshapenet-ikim.streamlit.app/): A Large-scale Dataset of 3D Medical Shapes**


**MEDSHAPENET FEEDBACK** is a platform for researchers to contribute shapes, provide feedbacks (e.g., report corrupted shapes for removal, suggest improvements) and showcase their own research/applications utilizing MedShapeNet. It is an important mean of communication for MedShapeNet developers, users and contributors for continuously refining the database and promoting the translation of shape-realted methods from computer vision to medical applications. Shape contributors have the chance of being credited as collaborators of the MedShapeNet project.
