## Overview

**MEDSHAPENET FEEDBACK** is a platform for researchers to contribute shapes, provide feedbacks (e.g., report corrupted shapes for removal, suggest improvements) and showcase their own research/applications utilizing MedShapeNet. It is an important mean of communication for MedShapeNet developers, users and contributors for continuously refining the database and promoting the translation of shape-realted methods from computer vision to medical applications. Shape contributors have the chance of being listed as collaborators of the MedShapeNet project upon request. For more details about the project, please check out our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16139.pdf) and [website](https://medshapenet-ikim.streamlit.app/).


## Guidelines 
By [filing a pull request](https://github.com/Jianningli/medshapenet-feedback/pulls) or [opening an issue](https://github.com/Jianningli/medshapenet-feedback/issues) in this repository, you can:


* **Report Issues**: report to us corrupted/incorrect/unusable shapes you found or request removal of certain shapes if you are the owners of the original datasets. [[issue](https://github.com/Jianningli/medshapenet-feedback/issues)]  <br>
*  **Contribute Shapes**: contribute medical shapes extracted from your own datasets. [[issue](https://github.com/Jianningli/medshapenet-feedback/issues)] <br>
* **Showcase Research/Applications**: describe your research/project that utilizes MedShapeNet by creating a new folder in this repository, following [this example](https://github.com/Jianningli/medshapenet-feedback/tree/main/anatomy-completor). [[pull request](https://github.com/Jianningli/medshapenet-feedback/pulls)] <br>
* **Suggest Improvement**: tell us the desired functions you want in the [MedShapeNet web interface](https://medshapenet-ikim.streamlit.app/). [[issue](https://github.com/Jianningli/medshapenet-feedback/issues)] <br>

Follow the following templates for issues and pull requests: <br>

### report issues
search query of the shape(s):<br>
description of the problem:<br>
(optional) screenshot of the problematic shape(s):  <br>

### contribute shapes
link to dataset(s): <br>
description of the dataset(s): publications, technical report, etc. <br>
contributor information: name, affiliation, homepage <br>
other comments: <br>

### showcase your research
Formatting is flexible. You can find existing examples  [here](https://github.com/Jianningli/medshapenet-feedback/tree/main/anatomy-completor) and [here](https://github.com/Jianningli/medshapenet-feedback/tree/main/forensic-facial-reconstruction)  <br>
