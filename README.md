**MEDSHAPENET FEEDBACK** is a platform for researchers to contribute shapes, provide feedbacks (e.g., report corrupted shapes for removal, suggest improvements) and showcase their own research/applications utilizing MedShapeNet. It is an important mean of communication for MedShapeNet developers, users and contributors for continuously refining the database and promoting the translation of shape-realted methods from computer vision to medical applications. Shape contributors have the chance of being listed as collaborators of the MedShapeNet project upon request. 


**Guidelines**  <br>
By [filing a pull request](https://github.com/Jianningli/medshapenet-feedback/pulls) or [opening an issue](https://github.com/Jianningli/medshapenet-feedback/issues) in this repository, you can:

<ul>
  <li>Report Issues: report to us corrupted/incorrect/unusable shapes you found or request removal of certain shapes if you are the owners of the original datasets [issue]</li>
  <li>Contribute Shapes: contribute medical shapes extracted from your own datasets [issue]</li>
  <li>Showcase Research/Applications: describe your research/project by creating a new folder in this repository, following [this example](https://github.com/Jianningli/medshapenet-feedback/tree/main/example-research-featuring-medshapenet)</li>
  <li>Suggest Improvement: tell us the desired functions you want in the [MedShapeNet web interface](https://medshapenet-ikim.streamlit.app/) [issue]</li>
</ul>
